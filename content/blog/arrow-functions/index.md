## Arrow Functions in JavaScript

[MDN: Arrow function expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: the need for shorter functions and the behavior of the `this` keyword.
