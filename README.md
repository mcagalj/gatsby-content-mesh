# Gatsby content mesh

Pulling data into Gatsby from different sources (local disk, local database, as well as remote sources: Airtable, Contentful and Google Sheet).

_Bonus:_ we also show how to use an excellent **FlexSearch.js** full-text search library to implement search and filtering functionalities (please check Google Sheet page at `/google-sheet`).

The site is available at [gatsby-content-mesh.netlify.app](https://gatsby-content-mesh.netlify.app).
